 \
 print "Protocols include but are not limited to EIA and TIA-232."
 \
 print "Common examples would include signals and media."

 \
 print "This layer is where you access your media using a mac address!"
 \
 print "Error detection is taken care of at this layer, but not correction."

 \
 print "Protocols include IP and IPX."
 \

 print "This would be your operating system. "

 print "This is also where connections are established." 
 \
 print "Common examples for this layer are application access, scheduling," 
 \
 print "and can be referred to simply as dialougues and conversations."

if choice == 6:
 print "The Presentation layer is how the data is presented to the end user."
 \
 print "It also handles any special processing such as encryption."
 \
 print "Protocols include ASCII, and EBCDIC."
 \
 print "Common data format is what this layer handles."

if choice == 7:
